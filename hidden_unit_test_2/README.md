## Test Case: `test_load_data_failure`

## Overview

This document describes a unit test designed to simulate a failure when attempting to load data from a non-existent snapshot in the Inventory Management System. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the behavior of the system when attempting to load data from a snapshot with an invalid ID. It ensures that:
- The system correctly indicates a failure when a non-existent snapshot is requested for data loading.
- The `requests.post` method is called with the expected parameters.

### Test Details

- **Test Name**: `test_load_data_failure`
- **Mocking**: Uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `requests.post` call, simulating the server's response for an invalid snapshot ID.
- **Expected Behavior**: The server should return `{'result': -1}` to indicate that the load operation failed.

### Note
During testing, the reponse has been modified to match what the server returns
