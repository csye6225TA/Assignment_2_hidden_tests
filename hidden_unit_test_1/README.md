## Test Case: `test_delete_data_failure`

## Overview

This document describes a unit test designed to simulate a failure when attempting to delete a non-existent snapshot in the Inventory Management System. 

### Test Details

- **Test Name**: `test_delete_data_failure`
- **Mocking**: Uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `requests.post` call, simulating the server's response for an invalid snapshot ID.
- **Expected Behavior**: The server should return `{'result': -1}` to indicate that the deletion operation failed (or any failure response).

### Note
During testing, the reponse has been modified according to the server response of the repository.
